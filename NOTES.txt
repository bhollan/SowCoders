Next time you work on this, make sure to add the cool monkey video.
Don't forget to check on your homework.


This cool new git thing is confusing!
"Commit" is to a repository like "save" is to a file.


We'll talk about branches in just a second.

So git is actually saving changes to the FOLDER and not to any one specific FILE.
It stores these changes in a file called '.git'

We can publish or "push" these changes to a "remote" repository.
